### What I learned
I used to have figma file from previous challenges so It was challenging at first how to get a right size then I had a look at the design of qr code component and noticed  the similarites of the size of their container and I use it as an example after I just worked with jpg so the key point here is I could learn to use my best jugment of the size to create this project.
When I was styling the links and added background color it didn't take full width so I was a bit confused then I undestood to use this:
```css
main a{
    width: 100%;    
}
```
I also learned about inheritance. I got to now that the parent properties like color  can be inherited to children by using value "inherit":
```css
main a{
    color: inherit;    
}
```
### Continued development
I will continue to explore and follow the learning path from frontend mentor to get more hands on experience. Also continue to use free plan which lets me improve my jugment skill to recognize the sizes and other stuff. I think this is the most important skill in frontend development.
